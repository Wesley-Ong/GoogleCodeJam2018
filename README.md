# Google Code Jam 2018 :zap:

The solutions in this repository are for the practice round and qualification round.

## Compiling the Solutions :hibiscus:
All solutions were written in Java and can be compiled (with Java installed) using:
> javac Solution.java 

Once the bytecode class file has been generated(a *Solution.class* file should appear), you can then execute them with the following command and feeding it a set of input:
> java Solution < input.in > output.out
The command above will then output the results of running Solution.java to 'output.out'.

For the problems that did not have an input, they use a python testing tool to validate the correctness of  your code. The command to run it is:
> python testing_tool.py java Solution
There should be a message in the command prompt that states if you were successful or not after running the python testing command.

For each solution, there is a sample input provided to test accuracy of the output.

## Thoughts :dragon_face:
I am proud of what I was able to accomplish by making it past the qualification round and into Round 1. 
*Unfortunately I was unable to participate due to the timing of the rounds and conflicts of prior engagements.*

Nevertheless, it was a worthwhile experience that tested abilities and I am happy about my personal growth.
